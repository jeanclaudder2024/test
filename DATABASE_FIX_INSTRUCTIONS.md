# Database Connection Issue and Oil Types Fix

## Current Issue
The database connection is failing due to a corrupted `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The current value shows:
```
"2025@]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com"
```

This is not a valid PostgreSQL connection URL format.

## Required Actions

### 1. Fix Database Connection
You need to manually correct the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables. The correct format should be:
```
postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

Example:
```
postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

### 2. Run Database Schema Fix
Once the DATABASE_URL is corrected, run the following SQL script in your database:

```sql
-- File: COMPLETE_OIL_TYPES_SOLUTION.sql
-- This adds the missing display_name column and populates with comprehensive oil types data
```

### 3. Verify Fix
After running the script, you should see:
- 13 comprehensive oil types including WTI, Brent, diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, LNG, LPG
- All oil types with proper display names, descriptions, and technical specifications
- Oil Type Management interface working properly in the admin panel

## System Status
✅ Application server running successfully  
✅ Admin authentication working (admin@petrodealhub.com)  
✅ Oil type management interface ready  
❌ Database connection needs manual fix  
❌ Oil types table missing display_name column  

## Next Steps
1. Fix the DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Run the COMPLETE_OIL_TYPES_SOLUTION.sql script
3. Test oil type creation in admin panel
4. Verify vessel filtering works with new oil types

The comprehensive oil types data includes major crude oils (WTI, Brent, Maya), refined products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel), marine fuels, and natural gas products with complete technical specifications.
