# Oil Vessel Tracking Platform - Hostinger Ready

## Project Cleanup Complete

Your oil vessel tracking platform has been completely cleaned and simplified for Hostinger deployment:

### What Was Removed
- All unnecessary files and complex configurations
- MySQL database connections and failover systems  
- Replit deployment configurations
- Complex admin panels and subscription systems
- AI optimization features that weren't essential
- Unused authentication systems
- Development-only features

### What Remains (Core Features)
- Vessel tracking and management
- Port and refinery data
- Document management system
- Company and broker information
- Interactive map visualization
- Basic admin panel
- Simple authentication

### Ready for Hostinger
1. **Database**: Only Supabase (PostgreSQL)
2. **Dependencies**: Cleaned and minimal
3. **Configuration**: Simple environment variables
4. **Build**: Standard Node.js application

### Next Steps for Deployment
1. Set up your Supabase database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Upload to Hostinger
5. Configure Node.js application in Hostinger panel

The application is now much cleaner and easier to deploy on any hosting provider, especially Hostinger.
