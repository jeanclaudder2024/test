### Manual Database Setup (Run in Supabase):
```sql
-- Run QUICK_DATABASE_FIX.sql to ensure all tables exist
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_broker_membership BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS broker_membership_date TIMESTAMP; 
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS broker_membership_payment_id TEXT;

-- Grant admin user broker access for testing
UPDATE users SET has_broker_membership = TRUE, broker_membership_date = NOW(), broker_membership_payment_id = 'admin_manual_grant' WHERE email = 'admin@petrodealhub.com';
```

### Test Payment Workflow:
1. **Login**: admin@petrodealhub.com / admin123
2. **Payment Creation**: POST /api/broker-membership-payment  
3. **Test Confirmation**: POST /api/confirm-broker-membership with `"paymentIntentId": "TEST_PAYMENT"`
4. **Verify Access**: GET /api/auth/me (check `hasBrokerMembership: true`)
5. **Dashboard Access**: Navigate to /broker-dashboard

### Production Payment (Stripe Test Cards):

- **Declined**: 4000000000000002  
- **Requires Auth**: 4000002760003184
