# Google OAuth Final Fix - Multiple Solutions

## Problem
Google OAuth showing "accounts.google.com refused to connect" even after publishing the app.

## Multiple Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Check OAuth Consent Screen Type
1. Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
2. Check if "User Type" is set to "Internal" - if so, change to "External"
3. Click "PUBLISH APP" if you see the option
4. Make sure all required fields are filled:
   - App name
   - User support email
   - Developer contact information

### Solution 2: Domain Verification Issue
The error might be because localhost isn't a verified domain:
1. In OAuth consent screen, under "Authorized domains"
2. Don't add localhost - leave this section empty for development
3. Only add your production domain when deploying

### Solution 3: OAuth Client Configuration
1. Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", make sure you have EXACTLY:
   `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback`
4. Remove any other localhost entries that might conflict

### Solution 4: Browser-Specific Issue
Try these browser troubleshooting steps:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Try a different browser entirely
4. Disable browser extensions that might block OAuth

### Solution 5: Temporary Workaround
If Google OAuth continues to be problematic:
1. Use the working email authentication system
2. Implement GitHub OAuth as an alternative (easier to configure)
3. Add Google OAuth later when the consent screen issues are resolved

## Current Working System
Your email authentication is fully functional:
- Users can register at /register
- Users can login at /login
- JWT tokens work correctly
- All platform features accessible

## Test Your Working Authentication
1. Go to http://localhost:5000/register
2. Create account with email/password
3. Login at http://localhost:5000/login
4. Full access to maritime platform

The Google OAuth is optional - your main authentication system is production-ready.
