# Google OAuth "Refused to Connect" Fix

## The Issue
You're getting "accounts.google.com refused to connect" because your Google OAuth app is in Testing mode but you can't see the Test Users section.

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Publish Your OAuth App (Recommended)
1. Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
2. Look for a "PUBLISH APP" button at the top
3. Click it and confirm publishing
4. This makes your OAuth app available to any Google user

### Option 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen Properly
1. In OAuth consent screen, make sure you have:
   - App name filled in
   - User support email selected
   - Developer contact information filled
   - Scopes configured (email, profile)
2. Save and continue through all steps
3. After completing configuration, Test Users option should appear

### Option 3: Check User Type Setting
1. In OAuth consent screen, look for "User Type"
2. If it's set to "Internal", change it to "External"
3. This will allow any Google user to sign in

### Option 4: Alternative - Use Different OAuth Provider
If Google OAuth continues to be problematic, your email authentication is working perfectly. You can:
- Use email/password authentication (already working)
- Add other OAuth providers later (GitHub, Microsoft, etc.)

## Current Status
- ✅ Email authentication fully functional
- ✅ Google OAuth configured but blocked by consent screen
- ✅ All database schema ready
- ✅ JWT tokens working

## Test Your Working Authentication
Try registering with email at: http://localhost:5000/register
- This works immediately without any OAuth setup needed
