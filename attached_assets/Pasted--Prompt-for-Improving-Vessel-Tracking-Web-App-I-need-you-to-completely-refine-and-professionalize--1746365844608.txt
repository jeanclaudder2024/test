Prompt for Improving Vessel Tracking Web App:

I need you to completely refine and professionalize the design, functionality, and performance of a vessel tracking web application. This is for a real client, and it must look and function like a high-end, production-level application — not a prototype.

Here are the detailed requirements:

Fix Map Zoom Issues:

When zooming out, gray areas appear above and below the map. This must be resolved so that the map always fits cleanly within the view.

Map Enhancements:

Show all vessels, refineries, and ports simultaneously on the live map.

Use a modern, clean map style.

Ensure all entities are visually connected in a clear and professional manner.

Design & UI/UX Overhaul:

Completely redesign the entire UI to be modern, professional, and user-friendly.

Remove all unnecessary components and clutter.

Make sure the design appeals to professional clients and encourages subscriptions.

Live Status Cards:

Add real-time status cards to the map showing vessel status, location, speed, and any relevant data.

Ensure these cards are styled cleanly and integrate seamlessly into the interface.

Missing Data Handling:

Use OpenAI's capabilities to intelligently handle and fill in any missing data that the API fails to provide.

Implement data enrichment where appropriate.

Full App Integration:

Ensure all parts of the app are connected and function as one cohesive system.

Check every page and module, and build missing parts if needed.

Use modern icons and components, especially for vessels and key elements on the map.

Performance and Usability:

The app should be fast, responsive, and intuitive.

Make sure everything works without issues and provides a smooth user experience.

Subscription-Ready:

Design and implement with the goal of user conversion and subscription — this app needs to impress.

Please treat this as a serious production-grade project and make professional decisions wherever necessary, including updating outdated parts or replacing clunky components with better ones.
