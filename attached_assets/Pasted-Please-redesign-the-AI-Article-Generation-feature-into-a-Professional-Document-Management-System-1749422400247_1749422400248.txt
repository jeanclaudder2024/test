Please redesign the "AI Article Generation" feature into a **Professional Document Management System** for the "Vessel Detail Page", with the following critical requirements:

---

ðŸ”µ **Rename & Concept Change:**
- Replace all mentions of "Professional Article" with **"Document"**.
- The system must not show anything labeled as "Generated" or "AI Generated" to the end users.  
  The final user must **only see a list of clean, professional documents**.

---

ðŸ”µ **Admin Panel: Document Management Module:**
- Add a new section in the admin panel named **"Document Management"**.
- I should be able to:
  - Manually create new documents by inputting:
    - Document Title
    - Document Description
  - Once created, your backend will automatically use AI to **generate the content** based on the title and description.
  - Your backend should **generate a downloadable PDF** for each document.
- PDF Requirements:
  - Must include our company logo at the top.
  - Must have a watermark with our logo in the background.
  - The design and structure should be clean, highly professional, and print-friendly.

---

ðŸ”µ **Vessel Detail Page (Client View):**
- Users will only see the **list of document titles and their descriptions**.
- No buttons or labels should mention "Generate".
- Each document should have a **"Download PDF"** button.
- Once clicked, the backend silently fetches or generates the PDF, then serves it to the user.

---

ðŸ”µ **Database Updates Policy:**
- **Do not make direct changes to the database.**
- For any changes you need to make to tables, **send me the exact SQL queries**, and I will apply them manually.
- Avoid using migrations or automatic schema modifications.

---

ðŸ”µ **Professionalism is Key:**
- The entire system (Admin + Client view + PDFs) must look and behave in a highly professional, polished way.
- The layout, spacing, and fonts should be clean and modern.
- PDF documents must look like they were prepared manually by experts.

Please clean up any previous script/code related to old article generation and start fresh with this more refined, document-centric system.
