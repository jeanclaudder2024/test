Build a professional, high-performance, fully interactive map page for my app. The map must be smooth, modern, bug-free, and better than any map on existing platforms.

📌 Use the following:
✅ Use the map service I provide (free map tile server) – do not use Google Maps or paid tiles.

✅ Use my custom API for vessel, refinery, port, and oil company data – integrate this API to fetch real-time positions and statuses.

🌐 Features to Include
🔹 Map Base
Use my custom map tiles (you’ll receive the tile URL format).

Full-screen display with zoom, pan, and rotate support.

Light/dark mode with toggle.

🔹 Live Vessel Tracking
Show live vessels from my API.

Use animated professional vessel icons (tanker, cargo, idle, moving).

Show:

Name, speed, destination, status, location.

Trail behind moving ships.

Support real-time updates and smooth transitions.

🔹 Oil Refineries, Ports & Companies
Show custom icons for each:

🏭 Refineries

⚓ Ports

🏢 Oil companies

Clicking a marker opens a popup with info: name, type, owner, production capacity, etc.

Draw visual lines (connections) between companies, ports, and refineries using animated lines if possible.

🛠️ Functional Requirements
Connect to my provided API endpoints for:

/vessels

/refineries

/ports

/companies

Implement a filter/search system to find and filter entities by name, status, type, etc.

Sidebar that shows details when a user clicks any icon.

Notification system for:

Vessel delays

Port congestion

Refinery downtime

🧩 Design
Modern UI/UX

Custom animated SVG icons (professional quality)

Responsive for mobile & tablet

No performance lag, even with 1,000+ entities

Ready to scale and integrate more features (e.g., weather, piracy zones, AI insights)

⚠️ Only use the free map tiles and APIs I provide. Do not use Google Maps, Mapbox premium tiles, or any third-party paid services.
Ensure the system is fully bug-free, smooth, responsive, and optimized for production.

If you want, I can also help you generate the base code setup with Leaflet or MapLibre (free open-source map engines) + your API integration to speed up development.

Would you like that? And please share the API format (URL and response structure) and free map tile URL, so I can help generate a live working version.
