Please **delete all previous scripts related to vessel movement or simulation** and rebuild the logic from scratch with the following professional requirements:

This is an AI-based Oil Vessel Tracking Application.

I am NOT using a live AIS API due to cost constraints. Instead, I want to simulate vessel movement on a map using manually provided voyage data.

Each vessel has:
- start_port (lat/lng)
- end_port (lat/lng)
- direction (optional – can be calculated)
- start_date (timestamp)
- end_date (timestamp)

---

### What I need:

1. **Simulated Real-Time Movement**:
   - Based on current time, calculate the percentage of time passed between `start_date` and `end_date`.
   - Move the vessel smoothly along the path from `start_port` to `end_port` based on that percentage.
   - Update the vessel’s position every 30 minutes on the map.
   - Position updates should be reflected on:
     - Main map (`oil vessel map`)
     - Vessel details page map

2. **Avoid Land**:
   - If the straight line intersects land, automatically apply a smooth curve or alternative path (just assume sea-only travel).
   - Basic logic to "go around land" is enough – no need for full marine pathfinding, just avoid showing it over land tiles.

3. **Status Handling**:
   - During movement, vessel status = `"Sailing"`
   - If current time < `start_date`, status = `"Not Started"`
   - If current time > `end_date`, status = `"Arrived"` or `"Complete"`

4. **Progress Bar**:
   - Use the percentage of time passed to update a progress bar (0% to 100%)
   - On reaching 100%, mark voyage as complete.
   - The voyage progress should work accurately. Fix any issue where it remains at zero.

5. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Use a timer or interval that updates vessel positions every 30 minutes.
   - Use linear interpolation for movement between coordinates.
   - Keep track of vessel ID so each vessel updates independently.

6. **Performance**:
   - Efficient code, avoid over-rendering or unnecessary reloads.
   - Use JavaScript and mapping library (like Leaflet or Mapbox) to animate the vessel movement.

Make sure the result is clean, optimized, and visually smooth. This system must work even if we have dozens of vessels running simulations.
