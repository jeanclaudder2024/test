Build a free, full-page map interface using Leaflet.js that shows ONLY oil vessels, with a modern, professional design and many helpful features for navigation, analysis, and monitoring.

✅ Features Required:
1. 🌍 Free Full-Screen Map
Use Leaflet.js (open source).

Use OpenStreetMap or Carto as the base layer.

The map must cover the entire browser window (100vw, 100vh) without white or gray space when zoomed in or out.

2. 🚢 Filter to Show Only Oil Vessels
Load vessel data (from API or local data).

Filter and show only vessels of these types:

Crude Oil Tanker

Product Tanker

Chemical/Oil Products Tanker

ULCC, VLCC, Aframax, Suezmax, Bitumen Tanker, etc.

Use your provided Excel list (Complete_Oil_Products_FullList.xlsx) to define allowed vessel types.

3. 📍 Professional Vessel Markers
Replace current icons with modern, professional vessel icons (SVG or PNG).

All icons should be consistent in size and not look cartoonish or unprofessional.

Show:

Direction arrow (pointing to heading)

Color by status: Green (moving), Yellow (waiting), Red (delayed)

4. 🧾 Click on Vessel to Show Info
On click: Open a side drawer or modal showing:

Vessel name

IMO / MMSI

Cargo type

Current location

Heading

Last port

Destination port

ETA

Speed

5. 🔍 Search & Filter Tools
Search bar: Find vessel by name, IMO, or MMSI

Dropdown filter:

By cargo type (Diesel, Naphtha, Fuel Oil, etc.)

By status (At Sea, In Port, Delayed)

6. 🛤️ Route Tracing (Optional for Now)
Show vessel route history as a polyline

Optional: Predicted route with ETA line

7. 🏭 Port & Refinery Markers
Add fixed markers for major oil ports or refineries.

Show tooltip with port name on hover.

8. 🧠 Responsive and Clean Design
Mobile-compatible: Map resizes on phones/tablets

Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

Use icons and hover animations

Dark/light map themes toggle

9. 🔄 Live Updates (Optional)
Use setInterval() every 30s to update data (or WebSocket if possible)

10. 🧭 Prevent Gray Spaces
Fix map so zooming out does not show gray/empty space.

Solution: Constrain zoom levels and prevent map dragging outside bounds.

map.setMaxBounds(bounds);
map.setMinZoom(zoomLevel);
