Please review and completely fix the current mobile responsive design implementation.

There are several serious issues that must be addressed:

---

ðŸš¨ CURRENT PROBLEMS:

1. **Scroll Not Working on Mobile:**  
   - On certain views like the map page, vertical scrolling is blocked.
   - This prevents users from accessing hidden content.
   - You must **ensure all pages allow smooth vertical scrolling** unless intentionally locked.

2. **Logo Size Issue:**  
   - The logo size has been reduced significantly in the mobile view.
   - Do not change the original logo dimensions unless requested.
   - It should scale **proportionally** for mobile, not shrink excessively.

3. **Map Display Issues:**  
   - The map takes over the screen and prevents proper content interaction.
   - Ensure the map is properly **contained**, scrollable where needed, and doesn't block UI elements or interfere with gestures.

4. **Content Visibility:**  
   - Parts of the UI/content are getting cut off or hidden on mobile.
   - Use correct responsive layout techniques (Flex/Grid, overflow rules) to make sure **all sections remain accessible** and legible.

âœ… WHAT YOU MUST DO:

1. **Fix scrolling issues**:
   - Ensure mobile screens allow vertical scroll.
   - Use `overflow-y: auto` or appropriate containers.

2. **Fix Logo scaling**:
   - Restore original logo size or scale it proportionally for mobile.
   - Donâ€™t override its dimensions unless absolutely necessary.

3. **Fix Map rendering**:
   - Map should resize properly and **not block scrolling**.
   - You may wrap it in a scrollable container or use touch gesture controls properly.

4. **Audit all pages for mobile responsiveness**:
   - All sections (login, dashboard, vessel detail, admin) must behave responsively.
   - Use breakpoints and layout changes based on viewport sizes.

5. **Test on actual devices**, not just resized browser.

6. Ensure thereâ€™s **no element covering another**, no UI overlapping, and **every action (click/scroll/zoom)** works smoothly.

This should be a professional, mobile-first experience that **feels like a real app**, not a broken layout. Please do not guess changes â€“ test everything thoroughly before pushing.
