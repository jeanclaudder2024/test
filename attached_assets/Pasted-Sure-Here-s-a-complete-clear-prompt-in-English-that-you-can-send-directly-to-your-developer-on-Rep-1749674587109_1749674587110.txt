Sure! Here's a complete, clear prompt in English that you can send directly to your developer on Replit. It covers everything: the new Brokers Page, the admin control, temporary access, and how things are expected to work.

🚀 Full Implementation Prompt – Brokers System
Hi,

We’re moving to the next step: implementing the Brokers System.

Please follow the full instructions below carefully:

🧑‍💼 Who is a Broker?
A Broker is a user who subscribes to a special plan called the Broker Plan.

Only after subscribing, they get access to a full Brokers Page.

But for now, during development, this page should be accessible without any login or subscription logic so we can test.

📄 What is the Brokers Page?
This is a dedicated page for each Broker (user with Broker Plan).
It includes the following 3 core sections:

1. ✅ Deals Section
Shows all Deals the broker has created by clicking Request Deal on the Company Page.

These are connections between the Broker and Fake Companies.

Each time a broker clicks “Request Deal,” the deal:

Gets stored and shown here

Gets pushed to the admin's panel (see below)

2. 📁 Documents Section
Shows all documents (PDF, Word, etc.) that the Admin has sent to this broker.

Broker can download each document.

Broker sees a notification when a new file is added.

3. 🛢️ Oil Market Alerts Section
This section shows static or placeholder oil market status.

Ex: “Oil prices rising today,” “Market drop expected,” etc.

Can be static for now — later we'll wire it with real data or APIs.

🔁 Relationship with Company Page
Brokers see only Fake Companies on the Company Page.

When clicking “Request Deal” on any company:

A deal is created

It appears in their Brokers Page

It also appears in the Admin Panel in a page called Broker Management Page

🧑‍💼 Admin Panel – Broker Management Page
Please create a page inside the Admin Panel called Broker Management Page.

This page should:

Show a list of all Brokers

For each broker, show:

All their created Deals

An upload field to send them documents

When the admin uploads a document:

It should appear in the broker’s Documents Section

The broker gets a simple notification inside the Brokers Page

⚠️ TEMPORARY RULE – FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY
✅ For now, all pages (including the Brokers Page) should be accessible from the Admin Panel or directly via URL.

🚫 Do not implement any login or subscription logic yet.

🔒 Later, we’ll hide the Brokers Page and make it visible only for subscribed users. But for now:

Show all pages openly so we can build and test UI and logic.
