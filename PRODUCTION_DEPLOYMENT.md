scp -r . username@your-server-ip:/var/www/petrodealhub

# 2. SSH into your server
ssh username@your-server-ip

# 3. Navigate to project directory
cd /var/www/petrodealhub

# 4. Run quick deployment
chmod +x quick-deploy.sh
./quick-deploy.sh your-domain.com
```

## Manual Deployment Steps

### 1. Server Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- 20GB+ storage
- Domain pointing to server IP

### 2. Required Environment Variables
Create `.env` file with:
```env
# Database (use your PostgreSQL connection string)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/petrodealhub

# Session security
SESSION_SECRET=your_very_secure_session_secret_here

# Stripe payment processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_secret_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_stripe_public_key

# Production settings
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Optional: AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Domain DNS pointing to server IP
- [ ] Stripe account configured with live keys
- [ ] PostgreSQL database created
- [ ] SSL certificate requirements understood
- [ ] Server access (SSH keys or password)

### 4. Run Deployment
```bash
# Full automated deployment
./deploy.sh

# OR quick deployment
./quick-deploy.sh your-domain.com
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check
```bash
# Test application health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T...",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production",
  "database": "connected",
  "users": 50
}
```

### 2. Application Management
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs petrodealhub

# Monitor resources
pm2 monit
```

### 3. Payment Testing
- Test Stripe checkout flow
- Verify webhook endpoints
- Test emergency authentication bypass (users 31, 42)

## Emergency Access

### Users with Payment Bypass
Users ID 31 and 42 have emergency authentication bypass for completed payments:
- These users can access broker features without subscription verification
- Bypass is temporary solution for webhook failures during payment processing

### Manual User Activation
```bash
# Grant broker access to specific user
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/emergency-auth-bypass \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "USER_ID", "reason": "Payment completed outside webhook"}'
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. System Health
```bash
# Application health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# System resources
htop

# Database status
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

### 2. Log Monitoring
```bash
# Application logs
pm2 logs petrodealhub

# Nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# System logs
journalctl -u nginx -f
```

### 3. Automated Backups
Daily backups are configured to run at 2 AM:
```bash
# Check backup status
ls -la /backups/petrodealhub/

# Manual backup
/usr/local/bin/backup-petrodealhub.sh
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. SSL/HTTPS
- SSL certificates auto-renew via Let's Encrypt
- HTTPS redirect enforced
- Security headers configured

### 2. Firewall
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status

# Should show:
# 22/tcp (SSH)
# 80,443/tcp (Nginx Full)
```

### 3. Database Security
- PostgreSQL configured for local connections
- Strong database passwords required
- Connection pooling implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
pm2 logs petrodealhub

# Restart application
pm2 restart petrodealhub

# Full restart
pm2 delete petrodealhub
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database
node test-db.js

# Check PostgreSQL
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificates
sudo certbot certificates

# Renew if needed
sudo certbot renew
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. PM2 Cluster Mode
- Utilizes all CPU cores
- Automatic load balancing
- Zero-downtime restarts

### 2. Nginx Optimization
- Gzip compression enabled
- Static file caching
- Proper security headers

### 3. Database Performance
- Connection pooling
- Indexed queries
- Regular maintenance
