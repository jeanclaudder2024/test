# PetroDealHub - Maritime Oil Brokerage Platform

## Overview

PetroDealHub is a comprehensive maritime oil brokerage platform that facilitates oil trading, vessel tracking, and company management. The platform serves brokers, oil companies, maritime operators, and administrators with real-time tracking capabilities, AI-powered features, and subscription-based services.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Maps Integration**: Leaflet.js for vessel tracking visualization
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom user tables
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Connection**: Drizzle ORM with connection pooling
- **Schema Management**: Type-safe schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration Strategy**: SQL files for manual schema updates

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth as primary authentication service
- **Fallback**: Custom JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **User Management**: Custom users table with subscription tracking
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with 7-day expiration

### Core Business Logic
- **Vessel Management**: Real-time tracking, document generation, route optimization
- **Company System**: Dual architecture with real companies and generated fake companies for brokers
- **Deal Workflow**: Broker requests, admin approval, document generation
- **Subscription System**: Trial periods, subscription tiers, payment processing

### External Integrations
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4o for content generation and vessel data enhancement
- **Maps**: Google Maps and Mapbox for visualization
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Email**: SendGrid for transactional emails

## Data Flow

### Core Data Pipeline
1. **Vessel Data**: Stored in PostgreSQL, enhanced with AI-generated details
2. **Company Management**: Real companies linked to fake companies for broker interactions
3. **Deal Processing**: Broker requests → Admin review → Document generation → Completion
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live vessel position updates

### Caching Strategy
- **In-memory caching**: Regional vessel data with 5-minute expiration
- **Database optimization**: Indexed queries for performance
- **Regional filtering**: Cached vessel data by geographic regions

### Document Generation
- **AI-powered content**: OpenAI integration for professional maritime documents
- **PDF generation**: PDFKit for vessel certificates and cargo manifests
- **Template system**: Standardized document formats for maritime compliance

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `/dist/client`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `/dist/index.js`
- **Assets**: Static files served from built frontend

### Container Configuration
- **Base Image**: Node.js 18 Alpine for security and performance
- **Port**: Configurable via PORT environment variable (default 5000)
- **Security**: Non-root user execution, minimal surface area

### Database Strategy
The application is designed to work with Drizzle ORM but does not require a specific PostgreSQL setup initially. The database schema can be applied to any PostgreSQL instance, including:
- Supabase PostgreSQL
- Render PostgreSQL
- Self-hosted PostgreSQL

The schema includes comprehensive tables for vessels, ports, refineries, companies, deals, and user management.
