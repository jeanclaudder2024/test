## Data Flow

### Core Data Pipeline
1. **Vessel Data**: Stored in PostgreSQL, enhanced with AI-generated details
2. **Company Management**: Real companies linked to fake companies for broker interactions
3. **Deal Processing**: Broker requests → Admin review → Document generation → Completion
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live vessel position updates

### Caching Strategy

- **Database optimization**: Indexed queries for performance
- **Regional filtering**: Cached vessel data by geographic regions

### Document Generation
- **AI-powered content**: OpenAI integration for professional maritime documents
- **PDF generation**: PDFKit for vessel certificates and cargo manifests
- **Template system**: Standardized document formats for maritime compliance

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `/dist/client`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `/dist/index.js`
- **Assets**: Static files served from built frontend

### Container Configuration
- **Base Image**: Node.js 18 Alpine for security and performance
- **Port**: Configurable via PORT environment variable (default 5000)
- **Security**: Non-root user execution, minimal surface area

### Database Strategy
The application is designed to work with Drizzle ORM but does not require a specific PostgreSQL setup initially. The database schema can be applied to any PostgreSQL instance, including:
- Supabase PostgreSQL
- Render PostgreSQL
- Self-hosted PostgreSQL

The schema includes comprehensive tables for vessels, ports, refineries, companies, deals, and user management.
