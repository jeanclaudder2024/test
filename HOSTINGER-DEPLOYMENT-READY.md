## What's Been Prepared

Your oil vessel tracking platform is now ready for Hostinger deployment. Here are the files I've created:

### Core Deployment Files
- `ecosystem.config.js` - PM2 process manager configuration
- `deploy-to-hostinger.js` - Setup script for your server
- `.htaccess` - Apache web server configuration
- `nginx.conf` - Nginx web server configuration (alternative)
- `hostinger-deploy.sh` - Build and deployment script

### Documentation
- `deployment-guide.md` - Complete step-by-step deployment guide
- `hostinger-upload-checklist.txt` - Checklist of what to upload
- `HOSTINGER-DEPLOYMENT-READY.md` - This summary file

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to Hostinger**: Upload your entire project folder to your Hostinger server
2. **Database Setup**: Create a PostgreSQL database in your Hostinger control panel
3. **Environment**: Create `.env` file with your database credentials and API keys
4. **Install**: Run `npm install --production` on your server
5. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to create production files
6. **Start**: Run `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` to launch your app
7. **Configure**: Set up your web server to serve files and proxy API calls

## Your Platform Features

Your oil vessel tracking platform includes:
- Real-time vessel tracking with WebSocket support
- Interactive maritime maps with port and refinery data
- AI-powered vessel distribution using OpenAI
- Multi-language support (English/Arabic)
- User authentication and subscription management
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for vessel and port data

## Database Requirements

Your application needs PostgreSQL with these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Hostinger PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI vessel distribution features
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - For additional data services

The platform will automatically create and manage all necessary database tables.

Your oil vessel tracking platform is production-ready for Hostinger deployment!
